# React Native 10 Projects Learning Repository

Welcome to the React Native 10 Projects Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through learning React Native by building 10 different projects. Each project serves as a stepping stone towards mastering React Native development.

## Technologies Used

In this repository, I've utilized a combination of technologies and libraries to build these projects:

- **React Native**: The core framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity.
- **Third-Party Libraries**: I've leveraged numerous third-party libraries to streamline development and add additional functionality to the projects. Some of these libraries include but are not limited to:

  - **Expo**: For rapid development and access to a variety of native APIs.
  - **Styled Components**: For styling React Native components with CSS-in-JS approach.
  - **React Native Elements**: For pre-designed and customizable UI components.
  - **React Native Snackbar**: For simple popup notication.
  - **React Native Music Player**: For managing music files.
  - **React Native Vector Icons**: For various fonts and icons.
  - **React Navigation**: For implementing navigation and routing within the applications.

By incorporating these technologies and libraries, I've aimed to create robust, efficient, and feature-rich mobile applications while also learning and exploring the capabilities of each tool.

## About

This repository serves as a simple React Native application repo. By building 10 distinct projects, I have gained a deeper understanding of React Native concepts, best practices, and tools. Each project is designed to cover various aspects of mobile development, including UI design, state management, navigation, and more.
